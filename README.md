# Epstein-Files
Niema's scripts and files related to the [files released](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/doj-disclosures) as a result of the [Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R.4405)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4405).

* [`scripts/`](scripts) — This directory contains scripts I wrote to help me automate various tasks related to downloading and organizing the files
* [`missing.txt`](missing.txt) — This is a list of document EFTA IDs I believe I'm missing (assuming all positive integers between 1 and the maximum EFTA ID number exist)
* [`url_list.txt`](url_list.txt) — This is my (potentially error-prone) complete list of document URLs based on the files I was able to successfully download
    * I created this because the pages directly on the DOJ website can be imperfect and/or difficult to enumerate completely
